## Description

The MVC-Tech-Blog is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site is deployed to Heroku. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

Upon starting, the user can sign up for an account with a username and password.  The password is encrypted when stored in the database using bcrypt.  The user can then login. The menu item "login"  will then change to "logout".  

The homepage displays all posts and associated comments from all users.  Once logged in, the user can comment on anyone's posts. Comments will display the commenter's name and the date it was created.

The dashboard displays posts from the logged in user.  The user can create a new post, or update or delete one of their existing posts. The post will display the creator's name and date it was created.

After being idle for 5 minutes, the user's session will expire and they will have to login again. Whether the user's session expires from being idle or if they click on "logout", the menu item "logout" changes back to "login".

All files describing the models and relationships between the models are under the models directory.

All files describing the user interface/html files are under the views directory.

All files describing the routes are under the controllers directory. 

The application is fully responsive and intuitive to use.
